# Real Notes (Work in progress)

A personal notes app with the features of a rich text editor

## How to run

Certain libraries are only available natively or only works in real devices, so its necessary to use Expo development builds.

> Alias for yarn eas build --profile development --platform android

1. **yarn build:android**

Scan the QR code, download and install the apk

> Alias for yarn expo start --dev-client

2. **yarn start:dev**

Open the download app and fetch the development server (this part is automatic in the most of the cases)
